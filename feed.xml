        <title>Easy to use</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Select and go:
The Pearl auto starts once plugged in and will load the last saved set list. That means the songs can be selected ahead of time, saved and within minutes of getting to the venue (friend’s sitting room or hotel meeting room) everything is ready to go.
Any smartphone:
Any smartphone with a javascript enabled browser can be used to select songs. The web application interface is so intuitive anyone can run the lyrics presentation from their smartphone. Unlikely other smartphone based lyrics presentation apps, no one has to hand over their own phone to anyone else in order to run it. What’s more, there’s nothing to install if the smartphone already has a javascript enabled web browser!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Video:
Supplied with a 1.5 metre HDMI cable and a HDMI / VGA connector the Pearl is ready to be used with the majority of televisions and projectors in homes, hotels, churches and convention centres. The audio out port can also be used to for RCA composite Audio Visual output. That means the Pearl has a video connection option for almost every popular display out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wireless Control:
The selection and presentation of songs can be controlled from any smartphone. The smartphone can connect to the Pearl WiFi Access Point. Alternatively, the Pearl can plug in the an existing network through it’s Ethernet port.
The wireless keyboard &amp;amp; touchpad is a convenient option to add or import songs on the go. Although any USB or Bluetooth keyboard and mouse can be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USB:
The Pearl has 4 USB ports which can be used to import songs from a USB flash drive or plug in an additional input device.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Compact</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Small enough to take with you anywhere. As you can see, it easily fits in a child’s hand. Even with the supplied power adapter, compact HDMI cable and HDMI / VGA connector, the Pearl fits in any musician’s gear bag. It takes up less space than a laptop and weighs less too. The Pearl can be discretely positioned behind, under, above or beside the TV or projector. That means it can be secured in place to. The Pearl is controlled wirelessly so no direct access is required once it is powered on.&lt;/p&gt;
